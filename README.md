# This project is a relational database management system for Gourmet Garden, a fine-dining Asian restaurant in NYC. 
# It streamlines table allotment, order management, staff scheduling, billing, and customer feedback using a structured relational model. 
# The database follows normalization principles (up to 3NF) to ensure data integrity and efficiency. 
# SQL scripts are included for database creation, constraints, and sample data insertion. This system improves restaurant operations by replacing manual processes with an optimized database solution.
